Network Discovery and Mapping
====================

*Tools for scanning and mapping out the network, discovering devices and services, and identifying potential vulnerabilities.*

### [üîô](#tool-list)[Nmap](https://nmap.org)

Nmap (short for Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network scanner tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, and to probe for information about their characteristics.

It can be used to determine which ports on a network are open and what services are running on those ports. Including the ability to identify security vulnerabilities on the network.

**Install:** 

You can download the latest release from [here](https://nmap.org/download).

**Usage:** 

```bash
# Scan a single IP
nmap 192.168.1.1

# Scan a range
nmap 192.168.1.1-254

# Scan targets from a file
nmap -iL targets.txt

# Port scan for port 21
nmap 192.168.1.1 -p 21

# Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
nmap 192.168.1.1 -A

```

### [üîô](#tool-list)[Nuclei](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/nuclei/get-started/)

A specialized tool designed to automate the process of detecting vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and infrastructure.

Nuclei uses pre-defined templates to probe a target and identify potential vulnerabilities. It can be used to test a single host or a range of hosts, and can be configured to run a variety of tests to check for different types of vulnerabilities.

**Install:** 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei.git; \
cd nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei; \
go build; \
mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/; \
nuclei -version;
```

**Usage:** 

```bash
# All the templates gets executed from default template installation path.
nuclei -u https://example.com

# Custom template directory or multiple template directory
nuclei -u https://example.com -t cves/ -t exposures/

# Templates can be executed against list of URLs
nuclei -list http_urls.txt

# Excluding single template
nuclei -list urls.txt -t cves/ -exclude-templates cves/2020/CVE-2020-XXXX.yaml
```

### [üîô](#tool-list)[Masscan]()

A port scanner that is similar to nmap, but is much faster and can scan a large number of ports in a short amount of time.

Masscan uses a novel technique called "SYN scan" to scan networks, which allows it to scan a large number of ports very quickly.

**Install: (Apt)** 

```bash
sudo apt install masscan
```

**Install: (Git)** 

```bash
sudo apt-get install clang git gcc make libpcap-dev
git clone https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
cd masscan
make
```

**Usage:** 

```bash
# Scan for a selection of ports (-p22,80,445) across a given subnet (192.168.1.0/24)
masscan -p22,80,445 192.168.1.0/24

# Scan a class B subnet for ports 22 through 25
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 -p22-25

# Scan a class B subnet for the top 100 ports at 100,000 packets per second
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 ‚Äê‚Äêtop-ports 100 ‚Äì‚Äìrate 100000

# Scan a class B subnet, but avoid the ranges in exclude.txt
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 ‚Äê‚Äêtop-ports 100 ‚Äê‚Äêexcludefile exclude.txt
```

### [üîô](#tool-list)[Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/)

A free and open-source tool for scanning IP addresses and ports. 

It's a cross-platform tool, designed to be fast and easy to use, and can scan an entire network or a range of IP addresses to find live hosts.

Angry IP Scanner can also detect the hostname and MAC address of a device, and can be used to perform basic ping sweeps and port scans.

**Install:** 

You can download the latest release from [here](https://angryip.org/download/).

**Usage:** 

Angry IP Scanner can be used via the GUI.

Full usage information and documentation can be found [here](https://angryip.org/documentation/).
