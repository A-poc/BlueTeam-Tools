### [üîô](#tool-list)[Nmap](https://nmap.org)

Nmap (short for Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network scanner tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, and to probe for information about their characteristics.

It can be used to determine which ports on a network are open and what services are running on those ports. Including the ability to identify security vulnerabilities on the network.

**Install:** 

You can download the latest release from [here](https://nmap.org/download).

**Usage:** 

```bash
# Scan a single IP
nmap 192.168.1.1

# Scan a range
nmap 192.168.1.1-254

# Scan targets from a file
nmap -iL targets.txt

# Port scan for port 21
nmap 192.168.1.1 -p 21

# Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
nmap 192.168.1.1 -A

```

```bash
# Scan for a selection of ports (-p22,80,445) across a given subnet (192.168.1.0/24)
masscan -p22,80,445 192.168.1.0/24

# Scan a class B subnet for ports 22 through 25
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 -p22-25

# Scan a class B subnet for the top 100 ports at 100,000 packets per second
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 ‚Äê‚Äêtop-ports 100 ‚Äì‚Äìrate 100000

# Scan a class B subnet, but avoid the ranges in exclude.txt
masscan 10.11.0.0/16 ‚Äê‚Äêtop-ports 100 ‚Äê‚Äêexcludefile exclude.txt
```

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks. It provides a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards for implementing and maintaining a robust cybersecurity program.

The framework is organized around five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions provide a structure for understanding and addressing the various components of cybersecurity risk.

The CSF is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it can be customized to fit the specific needs and goals of an organization. It is intended to be used as a tool for improving an organization's cybersecurity posture and for helping organizations better understand and manage their cybersecurity risks.

### [üîô](#tool-list)Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan is a set of procedures that a company puts in place to manage and mitigate the impact of a security incident, such as a data breach or a cyber attack. 

The theory behind an incident response plan is that it helps a company to be prepared for and respond effectively to a security incident, which can minimize the damage and reduce the chances of it happening again in the future.

There are several reasons why businesses need an incident response plan:

1. **To minimize the impact of a security incident:** An incident response plan helps a company to identify and address the source of a security incident as quickly as possible, which can help to minimize the damage and reduce the chances of it spreading.

2. **To meet regulatory requirements:** Many industries have regulations that require companies to have an incident response plan in place. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires merchants and other organizations that accept credit cards to have an incident response plan.

3. **To protect reputation:** A security incident can damage a company's reputation, which can lead to a loss of customers and revenue. An incident response plan can help a company to manage the situation and minimize the damage to its reputation.

4. **To reduce the cost of a security incident:** The cost of a security incident can be significant, including the cost of remediation, legal fees, and lost business. An incident response plan can help a company to minimize these costs by providing a roadmap for responding to the incident.

### [üîô](#tool-list)Ransomware Response Plan

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files. The attackers then demand a ransom from the victim to restore access to the files; hence the name ransomware.

The theory behind a ransomware response plan is that it helps a company to be prepared for and respond effectively to a ransomware attack, which can minimize the impact of the attack and reduce the chances of it happening again in the future.

There are several reasons why businesses need a ransomware response plan:

1. **To minimize the impact of a ransomware attack:** A ransomware response plan helps a company to identify and address a ransomware attack as quickly as possible, which can help to minimize the damage and reduce the chances of the ransomware spreading to other systems.

2. **To protect against data loss:** Ransomware attacks can result in the loss of important data, which can be costly and disruptive for a business. A ransomware response plan can help a company to recover from an attack and avoid data loss.

3. **To protect reputation:** A ransomware attack can damage a company's reputation, which can lead to a loss of customers and revenue. A ransomware response plan can help a company to manage the situation and minimize the damage to its reputation.

4. **To reduce the cost of a ransomware attack:** The cost of a ransomware attack can be significant, including the cost of remediation, legal fees, and lost business. A ransomware response plan can help a company to minimize these costs by providing a roadmap for responding to the attack.
